1. Let $$X$$ be a set and let $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$ be two metrics on $$X$$. Suppose for any $$x \in X$$ and $$\epsilon > 0$$ there is some $$\delta > 0$$ such that $$B_{d_2}(x, \delta) \subseteq B_{d_1}(x, \epsilon)$$. Then the topology generated by $$d_2$$ is finer than the topology generated by $$d_1$$.
2. Show that the standard Euclidean topology, the Manhattan metric, and the square metric all all indeed metrics and generate the same topology on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.
2. Let $$\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$$ be the set of all functions from $$\mathbb{N}$$ to $$\mathbb{N}$$.
